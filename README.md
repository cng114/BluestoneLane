# BluestoneLane

Bluestone Lane is an Australian cafe with premium coffee and delicious healthy eats. However, Bluestone Laneâ€™s pickup system is too chaotic- from unclear labels to slow service results in a large waiting crowd. The likeliness of an accident such as drinks being spilled is high, thus in-store liability increases due to the flow and layout at many Bluestone locations. Using a modified layout in receiving drinks will generate a new and efficient process for customers to go from obtaining their drink to adding their choice of condiments in a safer way.
